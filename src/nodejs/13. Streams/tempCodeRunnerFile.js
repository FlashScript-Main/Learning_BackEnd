    ðŸ”¹ so in Node.js, "Streams" are a way to handle reading and writing a data 
    they provide a way to work with a large amount of data such as reading of files 
    or writing of files or maybe receiving a large amount of data over a network connection
    without loading the entire data set into a memory 
    and stream can be readable writable or both 
    and can be used with a pipe data between different sources and destinations ðŸ”¹
