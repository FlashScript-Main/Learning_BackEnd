-- that's if I'm creating a new table 
-- but I already do have a transactions table I don't want to update it


-- however we can update an existing table with this Clause 
-- I already do have a foreign key constraint,
-- I'm just going to drop it real quick
ALTER TABLE transactions 
DROP FOREIGN KEY transactions_ibfk_1;


-- and that key is now dropped 
-- we are going to add a foreign key constraint to our transactions table 
-- with this clause üëâüèª ON DELETE SET NULL

ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id
FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- if I delete a "customer_id" from customers table,
-- the foreign key of that row will be set to "NULL" automatically


-- let's take a look at our transactions table
SELECT * FROM transactions;


DELETE FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 4;

SELECT * FROM transactions;


-- now there's "ON DELETE CASCADE" 
-- when a foreign key is deleted we can instead delete the entire row 
-- let's go ahead and add poppy puff back to our customers table
INSERT INTO customers
VALUES (4, "Poppy", "Puff");

SELECT * FROM customers;


-- Let's drop the current foreign key constraint of our transactions table
ALTER TABLE transactions 
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_customer_id;

-- we will add the "ON DELETE CASCADE" to a table that already exists
ALTER TABLE transactions
